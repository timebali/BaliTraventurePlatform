It is an ancient form of craft that was discovered in the 4th century BC in Egypt where mummy wrapping cloth was also coated with wax or wax to form a pattern. In Asia a similar technique was also found in China during the Tang dynasty (6180907) as well as in the Inid and Japan during the Nara Period (645-794), in Africa a technique similar to batik was also known by the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria. And in Indonesia batik is believed to have been found since the Majapahit era and became very popular at the end of the XVII century or the beginning of the XIX century, batik produced during the Majapahit era was written batik until the early twentieth century and stamped batik was only known after World War 1 or around 1920. Although the word batik comes from Indonesian Java, but the presence of batik is not recorded, G.P Rouffer argues that the batik technique was probably introduced from India or Sri Lanka in the 6th and 7th centuries, but another opinion says that J.L.A Brandes and F.A Sutjipti believe that the tradition of batik technique is native to the Toraja area, Flores, Halmahera and Papua because these areas are not areas influenced by Hinduism but are known to have ancient traditions in batik making</p>\n</span>\n<span id=\"batik-techniques\">\n<h3 class=\"font-small\">Batik Techniques in Indonesia</h3>\n<p class=\"text-justify\">The oldest batik art found in Indonesia was in the 17th and 18th centuries during the reign of the Majapahit kingdom, which at that time batik was only used by the people of the palace and their followers, over time this batik art spread outside the kingdom and become clothes that are also worn by the general public.
