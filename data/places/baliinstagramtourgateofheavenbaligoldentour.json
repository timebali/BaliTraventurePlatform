Pura Sad Kahyangan was established to protect Bali so that people continue to do things that are justified according to religious teachings. The establishment of the Lempuyang Luhur temple canâ€™t be separated from the event of the downfall of \"Bhatara Tiga\" in ancient times from Semeru Mountain in Bali and events after the event. Of so many sources, it is worth citing three of them, namely :</p>\n<ol class=\"text-justify\">\n<li class=\"mb-2\">In Lontar Kutara Kanda Dewa Purana Bangsul was declared Sang Hyang Parameswara carrying mountains in Bali from Jambhudwipa (India), from Mount Mahameru. The piece of Mount Mahameru was brought to Bali and divided into three major parts and also small parts. The center is made of Mount Batur and Mount Rinjani, while the peak is Mount Agung. The smaller fragments become the mountain slopes in Bali that are related to each other. The mountains include Mount Tapsahi, Pengelengan, Siladnyana, Beratan, Batukaru, Nagaloka, Pulaki, Sangkur Peak, Rangda Hill, Trate Bang, Padang Dawa, Andhakasa, Uluwatu, Sraya and Gunung Lempuhyang. In the Old Javanese language Lempuh which means \"gamongan\". He brought this mountain range that surrounded Bali Island by Sang Hyang Parameswara as the location of God's manifestation gods to guard Bali.</li>\n<li class=\"mb-2\">In Lontar Kutara Kanda the Purana God of Bangsul also stated that the Parameswara assigned his son Sang Hyang Agnijayasakti down to Bali and preserved the welfare of Bali and located on Mount Lempuhyang or Gunung Gamorangan along with other gods.</li>\n<li class=\"mb-2\">In the inscription Sading C year 1072 Saka stated that Gunung Lempuhyang also called Gunung Adri Karang. At Mount Adri Karang this is the King of Jayasakti, because that is the mountain also called Karangsemadi. King Jayasakti was instructed by his father Sang Hyang Guru to go down to Bali to build the temple to become a safe and prosperous area. King Jayasakti invites his priests and his helpers and people to realize the order of Sang Hyang Guru to build Bali by initiating the construction of the temple at Mount Lempuhyang as the statues of God as Sang Hyang Iswara. Previously, Raja Jayasakti did as a first step in building a peaceful life in Bali.</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Priest from the Lempuyang Temple are always held by one offspring traditionally according to the purusa (patrilinial) line, while the \"pengangge\" used in Lempuyang Luhur Temple is always white and yellow. When the aci or piodalan ceremony is held, all ingredients of the ingredients are provided by the \"Truna\" (youth), while those who work are \"\" Daha \"(krandan) are teenage women. This is so that all of them are sacred, because they are spiritual, although sometimes this cannot yet be a guarantee of the sanctity.</p>\n</span>\n<a href=\"https://www.baligoldentour.com/lempuyang-temple.php\"><img src=\"images/bali-interest-place/lempuyang-temple-1.jpg\" alt=\"LEMPUYANG TEMPLE | GATE OF HEAVEN | BALI INTEREST PLACE | BALI GOLDEN TOUR\" width=\"900\" height=\"500\" class=\"auto-width mb-3\" title=\"LEMPUYANG TEMPLE | GATE OF HEAVEN | BALI INTEREST PLACE | BALI GOLDEN TOUR\"></a>\n<span id=\"name-lempuyang\">\n<h3 class=\"font-small\">Meaning Name Lempuyang</h3>\n<p class=\"text-justify\">When talking about the meaning of the word lempuyang, here there are many versions of the meaning of the name lempuyang, because there has been no research that has detailed the meaning of the name lempuyang, so based on several inscriptions, community stories and historical interrelationships, it can be said that there are 3 versions of the meaning of the word lempuyang that has been circulating in the community, here we try to explain some of the meanings of the word lempuyang based on 3 versions</p>\n<ol class=\"text-justify\">\n<li class=\"mb-2\">The first version explains that the origin of the name lempuyang is based on a cultural book, where it is explained that the word lempuyang comes from the word \"lampu\" which means \"light\" and \"hyang\" means \"god\", so lempuyang can be interpreted as a holy light from a bright god. Lempuyang Temple is the palace of Hyang Gni Jaya or Dewa Isawara.</li>\n<li class=\"mb-2\">The second version explains that the word lempuyang stands alone where in Java the word lempuyang refers to a type of plant for bamboo. It is also associated with the existence of banjars around lempuyang named bangle and gamongan. These two banjar names are the names of a type of plant commonly used as medicine or seasoning</li>\n<li class=\"mb-2\">The third version explains that the word lempuyang comes from the word \"empu\" or \"emong\" which means guarding, where Bhatra Hyang Pasupati sent his three sons and daughters to carry out the task of maintaining the stability of Bali from various shocks from natural disasters. The three sons and daughters, namely Bathara Hyang Putra Jaya resided in Tohlangkir (Mount) Agung with Parahyangan at Besakih Temple, Batari Dewi Danuh resided at Ulun Danu Batur Temple and Batara Hyang Gni Jaya on Mount Lempuyang</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\">However, whatever the version of the meaning of the name lempuyang, Lempuyang Temple itself has a very large status, just like <a href=\"https://www.baligoldentour.com/besakih-temple.php\" title=\"Besakih Temple\">Besakih Temple</a> as the largest temple on the island of Bali. Great status both in the application of the concept of lotus buwana, chess loka nutmeg or even Dewata nawa sanga. As for the lontar or ancient inscriptions, there are three large temples that are often referred to, namely <a href=\"https://www.baligoldentour.com/besakih-temple.php\" title=\"Besakih Temple\">Besakih Temple</a> and <a href=\"https://www.baligoldentour.com/batur-temple.php\" title=\"Besakih Temple\">Ulun Danu Batur Temple</a> and <a href=\"https://www.baligoldentour.com/lempuyang-temple.php\" title=\"Lempuyang Temple\">Lempuyang Temple</a>. So these three temples already had a very large status in ancient times and as very important temples for ancient Hindus</p>\n</span>\n\n<span id=\"7-temple\">\n<h3 class=\"font-small\">7 Temple in Lempuyang Temple</h3>\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Lempuyang Temple was built for a worship of Ida Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa in his manifestation as Dewa Iswara who is known as the protector of the east.
