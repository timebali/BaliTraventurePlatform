According to Mpu Bhaskara Murti from Geria Madu Sudana in the city of Negara, when Mpu Dang Hyang Nirartha went to Bali, one of the temples he visited was the Rambut Siwi Temple. When he entered the temple, the temple guard required Mpu Dang Hyang Nirartha to pray at the temple. Otherwise, he will be pounced on by the tiger. Because it is required, worship him in the temple. It turned out that the temple was in ruins. Because of this, the temple guard finally apologized to Mpu Dang Hyang Nirartha. In addition, the temple guards requested that the temple be returned to its original state. On the wisdom of Mpu Dang Hyang Nirartha, the temple was returned intact as before. Mpu Dang Hyang Nirartha took a strand of his hair and placed it in the temple to be used as a means of worship in the temple. Since then the temple was named Rambut Siwi Temple. The name Rambut Siwi is more popular today.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\">When Mpu Dang Hyang Nirartha went to Bali, the ruling in Jembrana was I Gusti Ngurah Rangsasa. It is said that this ruler adhered to the teachings of Bairawa. Bairawa's teachings are derived from the teachings of Tantrayana. In ancient times there were many who misunderstood the teachings of this Tantrayana. For example, one of the teachings states that maituna is defined as free and erotic sex. The essence of the teaching of Maituna is a yoga attitude to strengthen and improve the relationship between purusa and pradana within. From this relationship will emerge a spiritual power from within that is greater. That spiritual power will be able to express the sanctity of Atman to reach Brahman / such a state of self that will be useful to build a healthy identity physically and spiritually. In Mahanirvana Tantra it is stated that Tantrayana really strengthens the power of Guna Sattwam and Rajas</p>\n</span>\n<div class=\"row row-tour\">\n<div class=\"col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12 pad-tour\"><a href=\"https://www.baligoldentour.com/rambut-siwi-temple.php\"><img src=\"images/bali-interest-place/rambut-siwi-temple-1.jpg\" alt=\"Rambut Siwi Temple in Negara, Jembrana Regency | Bali Golden Tour\" width=\"500\" height=\"275\" class=\"full-width mb-3\" title=\"Rambut Siwi Temple in Negara, Jembrana Regency | Bali Golden Tour\"></a></div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12 pad-tour\"><a href=\"https://www.baligoldentour.com/rambut-siwi-temple.php\"><img src=\"images/bali-interest-place/rambut-siwi-temple-2.jpg\" alt=\"Rambut Siwi Temple in Negara, Jembrana Regency | Bali Golden Tour\" width=\"500\" height=\"275\" class=\"full-width mb-3\" title=\"Rambut Siwi Temple in Negara, Jembrana Regency | Bali Golden Tour\"></a></div>\n<div class=\"col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12 pad-tour\"><a href=\"https://www.baligoldentour.com/rambut-siwi-temple.php\"><img src=\"images/bali-interest-place/rambut-siwi-temple-3.jpg\" alt=\"Rambut Siwi Temple in Negara, Jembrana Regency | Bali Golden Tour\" width=\"500\" height=\"275\" class=\"full-width mb-3\" title=\"Rambut Siwi Temple in Negara, Jembrana Regency | Bali Golden Tour\"></a></div>\n</div>\n<span id=\"biggest\">\n<h3 class=\"font-small\">Biggest Temple at Jembrana Regency</h3>\n<p class=\"text-justify\">The Rambut Siwi Temple is one of the biggest of all the Hindu temples in Bali and is located in the Jembrana Regency in the west of Bali.
