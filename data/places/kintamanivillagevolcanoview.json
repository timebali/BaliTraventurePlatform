As for the sources that tell about the history of Kintamani, based on history books written by historical writers, it can be concluded that the history of Kintamani based on history books is as follows:</p>\n<ol class=\"mb-3\">\n<li class=\"mb-2\">According to the opinion of the late Drs. I Nyoman Singgin Wikarman (a character, a fan of ancient literature from the Kintamani Bangli sub-district, thinks that Cintamani is a Sanskrit term found in the Vedas which means \"something that can give inner and outer happiness, wahya adhyamitka, (Bhukti Mukti), so naturally Raja Singha Mandhawa gave permission to the Bhiksu to build a hermitage on Cintamani Mmal Hill, because it was believed and felt that this place could bring happiness to those who inhabit it. This has been proven until now if there are residents who have lived in Kintamani Village for a long time will be reluctant to return to their original areas.</li>\n<li class=\"mb-2\">According to Sukarto, 1980: 2, the opinion that the word Cintamani comes from the words \"Love and Mani\". Love means romance, romance. Attractive, and mani means manikam, gem,. So Cintamani can be interpreted as a very interesting gem / love charm. From Cintamani to Kintamani, like Coromandel to Coromandel from India. According to I Gede Pudja., MA., SH in the Vedic book Introduction to Hinduism, argues that the word Cintamani is contained in the Vedas, namely a Maha Rsi who wrote the Dhanur Veda / War Engineering / Weaponry Science named \"Maha Rsi Wira Chintamani\" In Central Java there is a village called \"Cintamanik\". In Kekawin Ramayana Volume 2, sargah 24, in Wirama Sarisi verse 62, page 702 it reads \"Ika sugati alternating ta apageh, Susila salayania tan singsala, Twanging maguru gorawa angken garit, Ciwarcana cinita Cintamani\". Which is where in the Marriage of Ramayana Volume 2 the word Cintamani means \"Bead of Asta Gina\". This greatly strengthens the reality of the existence of Kintamani Village. Whereas in the Pakraman village, Kintamani has built a temple called Pura Manik Astagina, which is located to the east of Pura Tenten/Pasar Agung. This temple by Krama Desa Kintamani is believed to be the manifestation of Hyang Widhi's Sthana who bestows Taksu (Manik Sakecap) in connection with the success of a job, especially in the field of art, so that every time you start an activity, especially in the arts, so that you can succeed quickly, you should pray and ask permission at the temple. Asta Gina's beads. This temple is not only believed by Krama Kintamani Village, but other villages also strongly believe. This is proven by the villages of Banyunggede, Peludu, Shrink Kelodan, if they want to kill Jero Gede in the form of Barong, they will mature at Manik Asta Gina Temple and Tenten Temple.</li>\n</ol>\n</span>\n<span id=\"kintamani-view-batur\">\n<h3 class=\"font-small\">Kintamani for Mount Batur View Point</h3>\n<p class=\"text-justify\">We can watch stunning natural scenery of Penelokan, a combination of Mount Batur and the expanse of black rock with Lake Batur and on a blue caldera.
