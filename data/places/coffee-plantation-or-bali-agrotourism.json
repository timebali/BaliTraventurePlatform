In the early 18th century the Dutch  established coffee plantations on the volcanic islands of the Dutch East  Indies. This Coffee Luwak Arabica coffee hails from the mystical island of Bali. During the early years Dutch Coffee Plantation owners  forbade the local natives from harvesting and brewing the coffee beans for  their own consumption. The indigenous people, being resourceful, soon  discovered that the asian palm civet, favored eating coffee beans. These Luwak  beans were collected, washed, sun dried and then roasted to produce a coffee  with a deep richness, minus the acidity. The process of the bean passing  through the digestive tract of the civet chemically alters the proteins in the Coffee Luwak bean to yield more complex and smooth flavors, not found in  conventional coffees. Since then civet coffee has not been very booming as it is now, the beginning of the civet coffee boom around 2011 - 2012 where there is only one place, and since then many guests have been there and from word of mouth and social media, this coffee plantation has become very famous, and entrepreneurs seize this opportunity and start many coffee plantations along the strategic route passed by tourists</p>\n</span>\n<span id=\"process-coffee-luwak\">\n<h3 class=\"font-small\">Process Making Coffee Luwak</h3>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"> As for the <strong>process of making the famous Luwak coffee in Bali</strong>, most of it is still done traditionally.

After drying, the ore is stir-fried until cooked in the prepared frying pan, until this process has a distinctive smell of the famous Luwak coffee on the island of Bali.
